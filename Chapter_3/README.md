# Algorithm Analysis

## Primitive operations
- Assigning an identifier to an object. I.e. *a = 5*
- Determining the object associated with the identifier . I.e. *isinstance(a, int)*
- Arithmetic operation. I.e. *a + 7*
- Boolean operation with numbers. I.e. *a < 7*
- Accessing a single element from a list by index. I.e. *a[7]*
- Calling a function. I.e. *tito(a)*
- Returning from a function
